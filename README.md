===========

This will become a cuby worms clone initially :D

Will be using LWJGL (OpenGL, OpenAL) and PNGDecoder (Loading Textures)

OpenGL:

I'll use Vertex Buffer Objects because it should be fast when done correctly ^.^

This project is supposed to learn me a lot about OpenGL so it wont be optimized or anything for a long time :D

Library:

LWJGL - http://www.lwjgl.org/

PNGDecoder - http://twl.l33tlabs.org/dist/PNGDecoder.jar

The reposity name? Github's idea :D
